Hello! I am a second-year M.A. student and teaching assistant in the [Department of Linguistics](https://linguistics.unc.edu/) at the [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://www.unc.edu/). My research focuses on vowel reduction in constraint-based frameworks. More generally, I focus on theoretical phonology, with sub-interests in phonetics, morphology, and their interactions. My primary language of interest is Bolognese/Bulgnaiṡ, an Emilian language of Bologna, Italy.

My surname is pronounced as [ˈɑz.gɪn] ('Oz' like the wizard, plus 'fin' with a hard 'g').

Interactions: Evidence from Bolognese_"
